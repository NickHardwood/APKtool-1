requirement:
 qt-creator 3.5 and above.
 android sdk
 android ndk
 jdk 7
 
How to build:
This is a Qt5 project for android devices. I suggest you use qt-creator to build. Please build with newest Qt version(current is 5.5).


translations:
Any translations is welcomed. Please send me a pull request with your translation file.

prebuilt jdk and aapt:
It needs some cross compiling skills to do this and is too complicated to be explained clearly in a few words. You don't need to compile it again, in general.
I will give a detail if having more free time.
